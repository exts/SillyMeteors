More Important
- Update meteor code to move around the screen rather than grow in size
    - bump against the wall
    - spawn with random direction
- Add collision for meteors where they bump into eachother

Less Important
- Create Exit Button on GameScene + Gameover Scene
    - so maybe make this into a class for reuse or update sprite
    class to include collision ex.: sprite.clicked() and called
    in the events function? (returns boolean)
